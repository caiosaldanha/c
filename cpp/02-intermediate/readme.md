# Intermediate C++ Examples

This section covers the following intermediate C++ topics:

1.  [String Manipulations](./01-strings.cpp) - Demonstrates `std::string` operations like declaration, access, concatenation, length, substrings, and finding.
2.  [STL Vectors](./02-vectors.cpp) - Covers `std::vector` usage including initialization, adding/removing elements, access, size/capacity, and iteration.
3.  [STL Maps](./03-maps.cpp) - Shows `std::map` for key-value pairs, including insertion, access, checking existence, iteration, and removal.
4.  [STL Sets](./04-sets.cpp) - Explains `std::set` for unique sorted elements, covering insertion, existence checks, iteration, removal, and basic set operations.
5.  [File I/O](./05-file-io.cpp) - Demonstrates file input/output using `std::ifstream` and `std::ofstream` for reading and writing text files.
6.  [Error Handling (Exceptions, RAII)](./06-error-handling.cpp) - Covers `try-catch` blocks, throwing/catching standard and custom exceptions, and RAII principles for resource management.
7.  [Object-Oriented Programming (Deeper Dive)](./07-oop-deeper-dive.cpp) - Explores constructors, destructors, `this` pointer, access specifiers, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
8.  [Pointers and Dynamic Memory Management](./08-pointers-and-memory.cpp) - Details `new`/`delete`, `new[]`/`delete[]`, memory leaks, dangling pointers, and smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, `std::weak_ptr`).
