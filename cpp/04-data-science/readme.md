# C++ in Data Science Examples

This section provides examples of how C++ can be utilized in data science workflows, focusing on areas where its performance and control are beneficial, such as numerical computation with specialized libraries and custom data processing.

1.  [Eigen Library Basics](./01-eigen-basics.cpp) - An introduction to using the Eigen library for efficient linear algebra operations (matrices, vectors). **Note**: Eigen is a header-only library that needs to be downloaded and its path provided to your compiler. See comments in the file for details.
2.  [Simple CSV Handler](./02-simple-csv-handler.cpp) - A basic implementation of a CSV reader and writer, demonstrating custom data parsing and formatting in C++.
3.  [C++ for Performance](./03-cpp-performance.cpp) - Illustrates a computationally intensive task (dot product) in C++, measures its performance, and includes an extensive discussion on why C++ is used for performance-critical parts of data science pipelines and how it can be integrated with languages like Python.

Refer to the main [repository README](../../README.md) for general C++ compilation instructions. Specific instructions for external libraries like Eigen are provided in the relevant example files.
