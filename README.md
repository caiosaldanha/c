# C++ Learning Repository

This repository contains a collection of C++ code examples, organized by topic, to help beginners learn the language.

## Table of Contents

*   [Basics](cpp/01-basics)
*   [Intermediate](cpp/02-intermediate) (Placeholder)
*   [Advanced](cpp/03-advanced) (Placeholder)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
*   make (optional, for using a Makefile)

### Compiling and Running Examples

Most examples in this repository are single `.cpp` files and can be compiled using a standard C++ compiler. For example, to compile and run `01-hello-world.cpp`:

```bash
g++ cpp/01-basics/01-hello-world.cpp -o hello_world
./hello_world
```

For more complex examples or projects, a `Makefile` might be provided. In such cases, navigate to the example's directory and run `make`.
